Pre-generated visualizations for missions supporting COP and POART planning 


#### Purpose
In advance of the PLLs and COP meetings starting the week of February 13, 2023 the OHA/SIEI division wanted to provide some useful data points that may help as a launching point to these discussions and help hasten further exploration. The visuals provided here aim to provide a first step in identifying gaps and a baseline as they relate to COP priorities informed by Ambassador Nkengasong's [PEPFAR Strategy (5x3 pillars)](https://www.state.gov/reimagining-pepfar-at-20-to-end-the-hiv-aids-pandemic-by-2030/).

These supporting visuals are intended to help create and inform initial discussion and prompt further data exploration. We have provided notes, data sources, and calculations for anything included here to make this a jumping off point to delve into any software and explore further. If you have questions, please contact your SIEI backstop for assistance.
