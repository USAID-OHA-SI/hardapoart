### Purpose

In advance of the PLLs and COP meetings starting the week of February
13, the OHA/SIEI division wanted to provide some useful data points that
may help as a launching point to these discussions and help hasten
further exploration. The visuals provided here aim to provide a first
step in identifying gaps and a baseline as they relate to COP priorities
informed by Ambassador Nkengasong's [PEPFAR Strategy (5x3 pillars)](https://www.state.gov/reimagining-pepfar-at-20-to-end-the-hiv-aids-pandemic-by-2030/).

These supporting visuals are intended to help create and inform initial
discussion and prompt further data exploration. We have provided notes,
data sources, and calculations for anything included here to make this a
jumping off point to delve into any software and explore further. If you
have questions, please contact your SIEI backstop for assistance. Underlying R code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/hardapoart)
